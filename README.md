## iOS 18 Jailbreak Availability Checking Status

If you are an iOS 18 Beta to iOS 17 user or have an iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone 7, you have only web-based jailbreak solutions like Hacksnow and Cydia 2 tools.

Users of iOS 17 and lower versions on iPhone and iPad can still use traditional jailbreak tools such as Dopamine, NekoJB, Unc0ver, Palera1n, Bootstrap, KFD, and Serotonin.

## How to Jailbreak iOS 18 Versions on iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch Devices

### Solution 1 - Using the HackSnow Semi-Jailbreak Tool

Hacksnow is the currently fresh iOS 18 jailbreak without computer solution. After the jailbreak process, you can seamlessly choose Cydia 2, Sileo, and Cydia Dark versions.

Most Apple users recommend this tool as a trusted iOS 18 jailbreak solution because it can be set up without changing your system root files. This means there are no issues with voiding your Apple warranty. It's easy to set up, and you only need to use the Safari web browser.

### How To Setup / Install  Hacksnow for iOS 18 Beta - iOS 17 devices???

**Step 1** 

First, you need to install Hacksnow using the Cydia 2 iOS 18 official page. It is the only page where you can find the original version of Hacksnow for iOS 18.

**Step 2** 

Click the Hacksnow install button and open it through the zJailbreak official app store. Find the Hacksnow tool and install it.

**Step 3** 

After installation, you can start the jailbreak process. It will automatically check for jailbreak availability. Wait a few seconds for the iOS 18 jailbreak process to complete. Once done, you will see four default package managers. Select your favorite package manager to enhance your device.

(We highly recommend installing Cydia 2 on your iOS 18 beta device because the latest Cydia update includes up-to-date Cydia 2 repositories and tweaks.)

If you select Cydia 2, open it freely. You will see the latest Cydia interface.

Go to the Cydia 2 add source section, and a repo list link will appear. Click it to view all the repos, choose them one by one, and start exploring the best iOS 18 iPhone customizations without any hassle.

## What are the best iOS 18 jailbreak features of Cydia 2?

Support for 20+ Repositories and Sources (All are brand-new)

After installing Cydia 2 through the HacknSnow iOS 18 online jailbreak tool, you can experience an official repo collection. These repos are filled with the most popular iOS 18 themes, tweaks, games, jailbreak tools, and productivity-enhancing apps. These repos can be purchased in the Cydia 2 app or on the official Cydia 2 repo page.

Useful Tweaks Collection (Supports Both Non-Jailbroken and Jailbroken Devices)

You can browse and install very useful iOS tweaks from the Cydia 2 iOS 18 new version. These tweaks can help customize your default control center, lock screen, settings app, notification styles, font sizes, and many more amazing things.

Aesthetic Theme Collection (Find 100+ App Icon Themes)

If you are a theme lover, Cydia 2 is the best place to get an exclusive collection of themes supporting iOS 17 to iOS 18 Beta versions. The iOS 18 developer beta update introduced app icon modifications (dark themes), which some Apple users find interesting. However, some users don't like the dark features and prefer themes from third-party stores. So, Cydia 2 is a great alternative solution. Try it out today.

Best Tweaked Apps / No Outdated Apps Available

Cydia 2 repositories introduce tested and functional tweaked app stores in 2024. Recently, most of the tweaked app stores are outdated and not supported for iOS 17 and higher versions. But we filter them out and only allow you to install the latest apps with new features. You can also purchase them from our official tweaked apps page.

Online Jailbreak Apps for iOS 18 Beta and Higher Versions

After installing Cydia 2 on your iOS 18 iPhone or iPad, you can find hundreds of jailbreak apps, stores, and repo extraction methods. You can access Sileo, Zebra, KFD Apps, and Troll Apps through the Cydia 2 third-party repositories.

Easy Installation

Cydia 2 is an iOS 18 jailbreak solution that doesn't require a computer. By following a few easy steps, you can jailbreak your iPhone. No expertise in jailbreaking is needed. It can be installed and uninstalled at any time. No harmful elements are included. While some jailbreaks are very risky, Cydia 2's maintenance is simple.

Security & Usability

We guarantee that the HacknSnow tool and Cydia 2 are fully safe for your iPhones. Most iPhone users don't like to use Cydia jailbreaks because of pirate repos. Pirate repos are high-risk for your iPhone as they include malware, viruses, and device-stuck issues.

Does Cydia 2 Support Pirate Repos

No, we do not publish unsafe content for the latest Apple users. That's why we developed our own Cydia 2 repositories and sources, ensuring your device's safety.

iPhone users are looking forward to CydiaMine and Dopamine tools for iOS 17, which stands out as the great alternatives to Cydia 2 and HacknSnow. Unfortunately, these tools only work with iOS 15 and iOS 16 for now, and developers suggest that extending support to iOS 17 and higher is unlikely.
