![Themes-18](https://github.com/iOS18Update/Jailbreak/assets/166092918/11872b9c-0435-4151-83cb-d604b8f5a6b6)

If you are a theme lover, Cydia 2 is the best place to get an [exclusive collection of iOS themes](https://cydia2.com/ios17-themes/) supporting iOS 17 to iOS 18 Beta versions. The iOS 18 developer beta update introduced app icon modifications (dark themes), which some Apple users find interesting. 

However, some users don't like the dark features and prefer themes from third-party stores. So, Cydia 2 is a great alternative solution. Try it out today.

#### Tweaked Apps / No Outdated Apps Available ####

Cydia 2 repositories introduce tested and functional tweaked app stores in 2024. Recently, most of the tweaked app stores are outdated and not supported for iOS 17 and higher versions. But we filter them out and only allow you to install the latest apps with new features. You can also purchase them from our official [tweaked apps](https://cydia2.com/tweaked-app-stores/) page.

#### Online Jailbreak Apps for iOS 18 Beta and Higher Versions ####

#### Does Cydia 2 Support Pirate Repos ####
